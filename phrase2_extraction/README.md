This implements the standard phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based rule
extraction algorithms. But there is a twist -- this script also works with
phrases as atomic unit (instead of words).

Not pretty, but works.

To run, uncomment the call to main() and run:
    ./phrase2_extraction.rb example.txt
