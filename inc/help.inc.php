</p>

<p>The session can be paused at any time and continued later -- just press 'Pause'. Note that we are collecting timing information, so pausing your session on inactivity is important for us. You may also just reload this site upon your return and re-request the segment to reset the timer.</p>

<p>Please use only a <strong>single browser window</strong> per session at the same time. Going back to earlier examples is not possible, please take great care when interacting with the system.</p>

<!--<p><span style="border-bottom:1px solid #ccc">Known issues:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>The width of the canvas of graphical editor may be to small when adding a lot of phrases.</li>
  <li>The in-line editor may change height and span several lines.</li>
  <li>When editing phrases that have no contents, the input box is lower than normal.</li>
  <li>Mouseover is not detected for undoing.</li>
  <li>The interface only works with Firefox.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="border-bottom:1px solid #ccc">Notes on debugging:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>If the <em>string</em> of the translation is not changed (compared to the original MT output), there will be no pairwise ranking update. </li>
  <li>New rules are added (and known rules are annotated) in a leave-one-out fashion. Amongst other things, this implies that 'new' rules will first receive a weight upon their second occurrence. As OOV rules are added prior to translation, they are added immediately.</li>
  <li>Most tables are sortable (click on respective column in header row).</li>
</ul>-->
